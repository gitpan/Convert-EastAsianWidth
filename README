NAME
    Convert::EastAsianWidth - Convert between full- and half-width
    characters

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.10 of Convert:EastAsianWidth, released
    October 16, 2007.

SYNOPSIS
        # Exports to_fullwidth() and to_halfwidth() by default
        use Convert::EastAsianWidth;

        my $u = to_fullwidth('ABC');            # Full-width variant of 'ABC'
        my $b = to_fullwidth('ABC', 'big5');    # Ditto, but in big5 encoding
        my $x = to_halfwidth($u);               # Gets back 'ABC'
        my $y = to_halfwidth($b, 'big5');       # Same as above

DESCRIPTION
    This module uses the regular expression properties provided by
    Unicode::EastAsianWidth to efficiently convert between full- and
    half-width characters.

    The first argument is the string to be converted; the second one
    represents the input and encodings. If omitted, both are assumed by to
    Unicode strings.
